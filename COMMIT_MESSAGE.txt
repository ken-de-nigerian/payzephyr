fix(square): fix verification flow and refactor verify method

Fixed Square payment verification issues:
- Added missing location_ids parameter to order search API request
- Fixed verification to handle payment_link_id (providerId) in addition to reference_id
- Added payment link lookup as verification strategy before order search fallback

Refactored verify() method for better maintainability:
- Extracted verifyByPaymentId() for direct payment ID lookup
- Extracted verifyByPaymentLinkId() for payment link ID lookup
- Extracted verifyByReferenceId() for reference ID order search
- Extracted helper methods: searchOrders(), getOrderById(), getPaymentFromOrder(), getPaymentDetails()
- Reduced main verify() method from ~135 lines to ~27 lines
- Eliminated code duplication and improved testability

Updated tests to match new verification flow:
- Added payment link lookup mocks to integration tests
- All 659 tests passing (1,336 assertions)

Fixes verification errors:
- "Must provide at least 1 location_id" error in order search
- Payment verification failing when providerId (payment_link_id) is used instead of reference_id
