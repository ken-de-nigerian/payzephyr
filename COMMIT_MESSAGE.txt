refactor: mark core classes as final and fix Square driver

This commit makes core classes final for better OCP compliance and fixes
the Square driver API version and logging. All tests were then refactored
to work with final classes.

Part 1: Made classes final
- Marked all driver classes as final (PayPalDriver, StripeDriver, SquareDriver,
  PaystackDriver, FlutterwaveDriver, MonnifyDriver)
- Marked core service classes as final (PaymentManager, DriverFactory,
  StatusNormalizer, ProviderDetector, ChannelMapper)
- Marked controller and model classes as final (WebhookController,
  PaymentTransaction, Payment, PaymentServiceProvider)
- Marked exception classes as final (all exception classes)

Part 2: Fixed Square driver
- Updated Square API version from '2024-01-18' to '2024-10-18'
- Removed debug logging added for troubleshooting 401 errors
- Cleaned up unnecessary logs while maintaining essential operational logging
- Updated SquareDriverCoverageTest to reflect new API version

Part 3: Refactored tests to work with final classes
- Replaced partial mocks of final driver classes with real instances and
  mocked HTTP clients via setClient() method
- Replaced PaymentManager mocks with real instances, injecting mock drivers
  directly into the internal $drivers cache using reflection
- Replaced DriverFactory mocks with direct driver injection into PaymentManager
- Fixed status normalizer expectations in WebhookControllerCoverageTest to
  match actual driver behavior (drivers extract status from object/resource,
  not from type/event_type directly)
- Updated PayPalDriverWebhookTest to properly mock StreamInterface for
  HTTP response bodies

Test files updated:
- tests/Unit/SquareDriverCoverageTest.php (API version update)
- tests/Unit/PayPalDriverWebhookTest.php
- tests/Unit/PaymentRedirectTest.php
- tests/Unit/PaymentCompleteTest.php
- tests/Unit/StripeDriverEdgeCasesTest.php
- tests/Unit/SecurityVulnerabilityTest.php
- tests/Unit/WebhookControllerCompleteTest.php
- tests/Unit/WebhookControllerCoverageTest.php
- tests/Unit/WebhookControllerEdgeCasesTest.php

Results:
- All 659 tests now pass (1,336 assertions)
- Maintains full test coverage while respecting final class constraints
- Tests now use composition (injecting mocks) instead of inheritance
- Square driver uses latest API version and has cleaner logging
